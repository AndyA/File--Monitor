For a directory we can monitor

    * the directory object itself and the number of files it contains
    * the files immediately within the directory
    * the entire directory tree
        * for file creation and deletion
        * for all file changes

Need to rejig schema. Instead of trying to merge multiple options into a
single object separate out the public Object interface (of which there
can be many for any file) from a private per file object that actually
does the scanning.
