Revision history for File-Monitor

0.0.1   2007-02-01

        Initial release.
       
0.0.2   2007-02-01

        Removed idiotic idea of monitoring atime. What was I thinking?

        Started work on Linux specific implementation.

0.0.3   2007-02-02

        Deprecated the direct creation of File::Monitor::Object and the
        whole idea using individual F::M::O instances directly. We need
        to enforce the idea of a parent object to support platform
        specific monitoring support (which typically requires a monitor
        instance with a number of watches attached to it).

        Moved the Linux support into a separate (unreleased) branch.
