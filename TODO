Things to do:

    * Use native file monitoring interface on platforms where it's
      available.

    * Implement a "don't scan more frequently that every X seconds"
      functionality.

    * Directory scanning is hideously inefficient. For directories with
      the 'files' flag set we only need to rescan the directory if stat
      shows that it has been modified.

    * Investigate whether changes to the monitored directory are
      reported correctly under Windows.
